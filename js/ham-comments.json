    "YEAH BABY YEAH",
    "This is very tasty",
    "My husband started the ham while the kids &amp; I went to the mall &amp; as innocently funny as it is he put the ham in my Corning Ware quiche pan (ya gotta love him as he really doesn't know any better) so needless to say I was verrry careful basting this one",
    "It turned out great",
    "I only had light brown sugar &amp; used pineapple-orange juice (left over from new years eve Mai Tai's because someone ate the orange)",
    "I was really on to the clove taste so maybe I'll use less next time (maybe I'm not a fan?)",
    "Good recipe Sue we will use it again;)  You cant ask for a better way to fix ham",
    "The glaze was wonderful",
    "Seeing how I've made this ham several times I figuered I'd better give it the great rating it deserves",
    "I ensure the temp is 325ÂºF or less and I gently cover the the ham (not the entire pan) with a piece of foil to prevent the edges from over cooking",
    "I double the sauce, baste frequently for the last 45 minutes and serve the remaining glaze on the side",
    "This is a no-fail recipe and today for the first time I switched out the honey for pure maple syrup and it got rave reviews all the way around",
    "Thanks for sharing",
    "I didn't care too much for this",
    "The orange flavor was too overpowering and I didn't even use the full amount",
    "If I were to make it again I'd probably just leave out the zest and only use the orange juice",
    "I might also cut back on the dijon mustard - maybe 1 tbsp instead of 2",
    "Made per the recipe with one addition",
    "I also studded the ham with whole cloves",
    "Not too many cloves but I am glad I did because it helped bring a little bit more of the clove flavor to the meat",
    "Definitely a recipe to use in the future",
    "This was the best ham I've eaten in a very long time",
    "I made this for a Christmas party and everyone loved it",
    "Then for an added touch I kept the ham bone making sure it had some meat on it",
    "Then I got the 10 Bean Soup mix threw away the mix packet (Don't need it",
    ") and soaked the beans overnight",
    "Then I washed them the next day threw them into a large pot added 8 cups of water and the ham bone plus extra ham skin and some ham fat",
    "Simmered it for about a good 3 hours and made a pot of really good bean and ham soup",
    "It thickens as it cooks",
    "Then once it's done I took out the leftover fat and obviously the bone",
    "(I guess you could give the bone to the dog?) You can add celery peas onions spices whatever you want",
    "I just used water beans and the ham and yum yum",
    "The water soaks up all those fruit juices and brown sugar that's left on the meat and bone",
    "Thanks Sue for a wonder and newly traditional Christmas meal",
    "I will make this next year for Christmas or maybe earlier and of course my bean soup",
    ":)  this is very close to my recipe but just enough diffrence that I thought I would try it",
    "First time -- not enough sauce for ham and family did not like the cloves in the sauce",
    "Second time I doubled the sauce omitting the crushed cloves",
    "I also coved the top of the ham with tin foil and kind of \"tent-ed\" it so that it would not touch the ham",
    "I made one small hole to vent it just slightly",
    "I scored my ham and placed whole cloves in the ham",
    "I cooked on 200 degrees and cooked for a longer time",
    "I basted the ham once an hour and half way through I put pineapple rings and cherries on it and basted more",
    "When I felt like the ham was done I sat the pan on my counter to let the ham rest and juices to come back so would be moist and I basted it very well one more time, covered and left alone until it was time to slice and put on the table",
    "It turned out very well glazed, moist, and delicious",
    "My family liked it better this time around",
    "Oh, you pull out the whole cloves and discard them",
    "The sauce was just right --not too thin and not to thick",
    "Yummy",
    "I added a jar of orange marmalade 2 teaspoons of minced garlic 3/4 c (extra) of brown sugar and zest from an orange and 1 cup of pineapple juice",
    "Yumm",
    "Great recipe",
    "Loved it",
    "Great recipe",
    "I fixed this as part of a buffet for a Superbowl party, and it looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful",
    "(Sadly, I can only assume it tasted wonderful because everyone raved about how good it was",
    "but by the time I finished in the kitchen and got my plate - it was already gone, so I only got a few little scraps",
    ") For ease of preparation, I fixed a fruit salad with it, and used the drained juice from the canned pineapple, and substituted 1/3 cup of orange juice because I forgot to buy an orange",
    "It was much easier to make than other recipes I have used - yet tasted like it had taken a ton of effort",
    "I normally use more complex recipes from the major cooking magazines that can require dozens of spices and ingredients, as I love to experiment with flavors and love gourmet food, so I was leary of how simple this was",
    "but with a very limited budget and limited prep time for this party, I decided to try this one - and was VERY pleased",
    "It looked delicious on the table, and it was the first to disappear on the buffet - I will be throwing away my other ham recipes, and sticking with this one",
    "I made this for Thanksgiving and it was an absolute HIT",
    "I do not eat Ham but I fed this to about 10 diffrent people and they All said it was fantstic",
    "Instead of cooking it they way they did I made the glaze, put the ham and glaze in a bag, shook it up reall good and baked it in the bag for about 3hrs",
    "Alot easier then basting every 10 min",
    "This was wonderful, I will be using this glaze on my ham from now on",
    "I added pineapple rings and cherry's for the last 30 minutes and brushed the glaze over them, it candied and made for a wonderful garnish",
    "Wonderful flavor",
    "I put the ham in a roaster pan and poured 1 cup of water inside the pan as the ham instructions stated",
    "It also said to cover the ham with foil, so I covered it with foil ONLY for 1st hour but I won't be doing that again because the outside of the ham started to get crispy too soon, so next time I'll cover the ham in the last 35mins of baking instead",
    "Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated and was quite satisfied with the results",
    "I think I'm going to add 1 1/2 - 2cups of water inside the roasting pan because that water gets the ham moist and it serves as a \"dip\" when you glaze the ham",
    "Any glaze that falls down to the bottom of the pan, falls into that water and it is delicious",
    "Once the ham is done and you are ready to serve the ham slices, dip the slices of ham into that glazed water mixture at the bottom of the pan",
    "It makes the ham so moist and you get to taste the glaze a bit more",
    "Excellent",
    "My only variation of the recipe was that I spiked the ham with whole cloves and so I left out the ground cloves",
    "From now on I will always use this recipe for my holiday hams",
    "This recipe is just incredible",
    "I have gotten so many compliments",
    "my husband even volunteered me to make this for his work party at Christmas",
    "The first time I made it I stuck exactly to the recipe and it was very good",
    "I made some changes the last time because of the ingredients I had on hand, and it still came out wonderfully",
    "I added more pineapple juice and used both golden and dark brown sugars",
    "I also added some cinnamon, onion and garlic powder",
    "Don't be afraid to play with this recipe",
    "it's very versatile",
    "I used an inexpensive 8 lb ham &amp; trimmed off any really thick areas of fat",
    "Diamond scored the outside",
    "Placed the ham cut side down in a heavy disposable roasting pan with 1/2 bottle of Honey Brown Ale",
    "Studded the ham with whole cloves vs using ground in glaze",
    "Used 1/4 C real maple syrup vs honey &amp; reduced brn sugar by 1/4C",
    "I used orange juice (I had orange zest on hand) &amp; reduced glaze down a bit longer",
    "I heavily brushed glaze on initially prior to my tradition of toothpicking fresh pineapple rings on",
    "Loosely tented ham w/foil for 1st 2 hours @300 degrees",
    "Uncovered, then 'spooned' glaze on every 15 minutes for another hour at 325",
    "The BEST ham and my company thought it was DELICIOUS",
    "Moist, tender and using an electric knife makes slicing a breeze",
    "Spiral sliced ham won't be going in my cart again, LOL",
    "I didn't deviate too much from recipe and it's so easy",
    "Tip: You can bake ham earlier in day, let it rest (loosely covered) for 30 minutes",
    "At this point I slice &amp; pile on oven safe platter, spoon on some drippings, cover tightly and re-heat about 15 minutes before serving",
    "Makes my life in the kitchen easier with the sides, etc",
    "needing the oven space",
    "just a mention :) Very yummy",
    "I made this for a surprise 50th birthday party and got many compliments",
    "I used light brown sugar (didn't have dark on hand) and wrapped the ham in foil while baking so it didn't dry out",
    "Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated",
    "This is a great and easy recipe",
    "Excellent recipe Elisa",
    "Like others suggested I doubled the glaze but kept the cloves at a minimum",
    "I had no trouble with the glaze burning on the bottom of the pan but maybe that was because the instructions on my spiral ham suggested it be cooked at 250 degrees",
    "I ended up adding cornstarch/water to the rest which made a delicious sauce",
    "Thank you so much and no more packets for me",
    "I didn't care too much for this",
    "The orange flavor was too overpowering and I didn't even use the full amount",
    "If I were to make it again I'd probably just leave out the zest and only use the orange juice",
    "I might also cut back on the dijon mustard - maybe 1 tbsp instead of 2",
    "Had a 8 pound not cooked ham and wasn't sure when to start basting so started after it had cooked for 2 hours",
    "Delicious",
    "Husband thought the gravy was too sweet though but he's not a ham person",
    "This was a delicious glaze",
    "Instead of brushing on the glaze last I just dumped the entire glaze mixture onto the ham and into a baking bag with the ham",
    "I tossed in some pineapple slices too",
    "Then I cooked it at 325 for 2 hrs",
    "The 6 lb ham I used turned out moist and delicious",
    "Absolutely wonderful",
    "I bought a spiral sliced ham that had the glaze packet and tossed the packet",
    "This glaze recipe is SO good",
    "I didn't have an orange so just used 1/3 cup orange juice",
    "Also, I reduced the oven temp, according to the directions on the ham I purchased, to 300",
    "I shortened the total cooking time by about 1/2 hour so it wouldn't dry out",
    "The result was beautiful",
    "Update:  I did this again for Christmas Eve this year",
    "I wrapped the ham in foil and poured the glaze over the ham",
    "This is THE BEST glaze",
    "No need to look further",
    "OH YUM",
    "I have used this glaze a lot and every time EXCELLENT",
    "The ham remains very juicy and oh so sweet",
    "I put pineapple rings all over the ham before I start baking it and maraschino cherries in the middle of those rings",
    "Then start to glaze 45 minutes before it's done",
    "Sooooo tasty",
    "Also don't forget that when you cover the ham with tinfoil tent it so it doesn't lay against the ham keeps it even juicier",
    "Thanks for sharing Sue",
    "I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it",
    "Thanks",
    "Very good",
    "Due to what was on hand and personal preference I used a mixture of dk",
    "and lt",
    "brown sugar 1/3 c",
    "prepared orange juice regular mustard and no cloves",
    "Put pineapples and cherries on with first application of glaze and basted them with glaze for 2 more applications and one additional basting with pan drippiings/glaze mixture which was also delicious served on the side as is",
    "I did tent the ham after first hour and cooked 2 1/2 hours total prior to adding glaze",
    "Much enjoyed by all",
    "Been improvising this glaze for years",
    "Stud the ham with cloves after cutting diagonal pattern on top",
    "Decorated with pineapples as shown",
    "Did not have Dijon mustard so used brown mustard",
    "Also tasty",
    "WOW",
    "This glaze was delicious",
    "I used clementines instead of an orange and it came out great",
    "Great recipe",
    "I fixed this as part of a buffet for a Superbowl party, and it looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful",

    "I loved it",
    "My husband thought it was okay (hence the 4 stars)",
    "I think the reason he didn't like it as much was because we could taste the mustard and he is not a huge mustard fan",
    "We'd probably make it again with less mustard in it",
    "Thanks",
    "I love this glaze",
    "I couldn't stop licking the pot",
    "I used half an orange and I bought a can of pineapple rings in their own juice and used that as well",
    "Came out pretty and just so good",
    "My first time cooking a ham",
    "Followed the recipe as is and turned out GREAT",
    "The orange (juice/zest) gives it a very nice flavor",
    "Very good glaze",
    "I served some extra at the table as a sauce and it was delicious",
    "Perfect blend of sweet and tangy",
    "The Glaze recipe is FANTASTIC",
    "The sweetness of the fruit mixed with the Dijon mustard is so delicious and has a nice little kick to it",
    "I used an apricot puree instead of the pineapple and orange and I did the ham in a slow cooker and it tasted absolutely amazing",
    "I even made a little more to use as a dip",
    "All around FANTASTIC",
    "So good",
    "I put the pineapple and cherries on top and used regular mustard since I didn't have Dijon",
    "It looked like it could he photographed for a magazine and tasted like something I could impress with",
    "Thanks",
    "I put water on the bottom of the pan so the ham wouldn't dry out was great",
    "This is an awesome recipe- my friends have gone nuts over the glaze",
    "I just make a couple tweaks to it- I'm not much a fan of cloves so I leave them out",
    "Also if you just include a little orange zest and leave out the juice it's perfect for those who think an orange flavor is a little overwhelming (like me)",
    "Great taste",
    "Great recipe",
    "I fixed this as part of a buffet for a Superbowl party, and it looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful",

    "Wow",
    "We are a family who doesn't love ham but this just became an instant hit",
    "I plan to add this into our monthly rotation which is saying a lot as we usually have ham twice a year at most",
    "This was soooo good",

    "absolutely delicious",
    "Made it for Thanksgiving and could not have been more pleased with the presence and taste",
    "Will make again and again",
    "Thank you for this recipe  This will be my 3rd year making this ham for Thanksgiving and it is great",
    "Everyone asks for the recipe",
    "I feel kind of guilty that my ham is always eaten and the other hams are hardly touched",
    "Part of the key to success is to not use the spiral-cut ham",
    "Spiral cut hams are dry and awful compared to this ham",
    "yum",
    "i used orange marmalade and orange juice instead and doubled the dijon it was delicious",
    "next time i would buy a better quality ham",
    "and if i had whlole cloves i would have put them in the meat to better flavor it",
    "since i was going to be gone while it cooked i combined all ingredients in a bowl then poured over the ham in an oven bag in my roasting pan put the lid on and baked at 275 for 4 hours then when i got home took the lid off opened the bag and basted it and cooked for about 30 more min without the lid",
    "i also had put carrots in the bag with the ham just like i would for a roast and the were delicious",
    "i'm so glad i did i would definitely recommend everyone does it",
    "This has become THE glaze recipe of our family",
    "A mere mention of this recipe sends my kids begging and pleading for it",
    "During the several times that I have made this I have found it useful to regularly pull the ham out and use my baster to squirt the glaze/juice evenly over the ham",
    "This promotes an even flavor and beautiful color",
    "I would have rated this stars if possible",
    "I give the glaze a 5-star but do not put a pre-cooked ham in the oven for two hours at that temperature",
    "I only had an 8 1/2 pound ham and it only took about 40 minutes total",
    "Please pay attention to the instructions that come with your ham",
    "I think I added a bit more orange juice and a little less zest but the glaze is great",
    "just keep basting that ham",
    "The sweetest and most delicious ham I've EVER had",
    "Since the instructions don't specify when to add the syrup we ended up pouring it over the top after the fruit was toothpicked in which created a really nice glaze over it all",
    "I've made this twice now -- once for Christmas and once for Easter",
    "Several people said it was the best ham they've ever had and they asked if they could take some leftovers home with them",
    "I ended up being bummed because there was hardly any leftovers for me and my boyfriend",
    "The first time I made I tripled the glaze and used a whole large orange",
    "It was a tad too orangy for my boyfriend's plain palate and there was way too much glaze in the pan",
    "The second time I made I just used a small not very juicy orange and used the amount of glaze the recipe called for",
    "It was still good but got a little crispy around some of the edges",
    "Next time I make I think the solution would be to just double the glaze",
    "I also stuck some whole cloves directly into the ham during the initial 2 hours of cooking",
    "I love pig",
    "Great recipe",
    "I fixed this as part of a buffet for a Superbowl party, and it looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful",
    "(Sadly, I can only assume it tasted wonderful because everyone raved about how good it was",
    "but by the time I finished in the kitchen and got my plate - it was already gone, so I only got a few little scraps",
    ") For ease of preparation, I fixed a fruit salad with it, and used the drained juice from the canned pineapple, and substituted 1/3 cup of orange juice because I forgot to buy an orange",
    "It was much easier to make than other recipes I have used - yet tasted like it had taken a ton of effort",
    "I normally use more complex recipes from the major cooking magazines that can require dozens of spices and ingredients, as I love to experiment with flavors and love gourmet food, so I was leary of how simple this was",
    "but with a very limited budget and limited prep time for this party, I decided to try this one - and was VERY pleased",
    "It looked delicious on the table, and it was the first to disappear on the buffet - I will be throwing away my other ham recipes, and sticking with this one",
    "I made this for Thanksgiving and it was an absolute HIT",
    "I do not eat Ham but I fed this to about 10 diffrent people and they All said it was fantstic",
    "Instead of cooking it they way they did I made the glaze, put the ham and glaze in a bag, shook it up reall good and baked it in the bag for about 3hrs",
    "Alot easier then basting every 10 min",
    "This was wonderful, I will be using this glaze on my ham from now on",
    "I added pineapple rings and cherry's for the last 30 minutes and brushed the glaze over them, it candied and made for a wonderful garnish",
    "Wonderful flavor",
    "I put the ham in a roaster pan and poured 1 cup of water inside the pan as the ham instructions stated",
    "It also said to cover the ham with foil, so I covered it with foil ONLY for 1st hour but I won't be doing that again because the outside of the ham started to get crispy too soon, so next time I'll cover the ham in the last 35mins of baking instead",
    "Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated and was quite satisfied with the results",
    "I think I'm going to add 1 1/2 - 2cups of water inside the roasting pan because that water gets the ham moist and it serves as a \"dip\" when you glaze the ham",
    "Any glaze that falls down to the bottom of the pan, falls into that water and it is delicious",
    "Once the ham is done and you are ready to serve the ham slices, dip the slices of ham into that glazed water mixture at the bottom of the pan",
    "It makes the ham so moist and you get to taste the glaze a bit more",
    "Excellent",
    "My only variation of the recipe was that I spiked the ham with whole cloves and so I left out the ground cloves",
    "From now on I will always use this recipe for my holiday hams",
    "This recipe is just incredible",
    "I have gotten so many compliments",
    "my husband even volunteered me to make this for his work party at Christmas",
    "The first time I made it I stuck exactly to the recipe and it was very good",
    "I made some changes the last time because of the ingredients I had on hand, and it still came out wonderfully",
    "I added more pineapple juice and used both golden and dark brown sugars",
    "I also added some cinnamon, onion and garlic powder",
    "Don't be afraid to play with this recipe",
    "it's very versatile",
    "I used an inexpensive 8 lb ham &amp; trimmed off any really thick areas of fat",
    "Diamond scored the outside",
    "Placed the ham cut side down in a heavy disposable roasting pan with 1/2 bottle of Honey Brown Ale",
    "Studded the ham with whole cloves vs using ground in glaze",
    "Used 1/4 C real maple syrup vs honey &amp; reduced brn sugar by 1/4C",
    "I used orange juice (I had orange zest on hand) &amp; reduced glaze down a bit longer",
    "I heavily brushed glaze on initially prior to my tradition of toothpicking fresh pineapple rings on",
    "Loosely tented ham w/foil for 1st 2 hours @300 degrees",
    "Uncovered, then 'spooned' glaze on every 15 minutes for another hour at 325",
    "The BEST ham and my company thought it was DELICIOUS",
    "Moist, tender and using an electric knife makes slicing a breeze",
    "Spiral sliced ham won't be going in my cart again, LOL",
    "I didn't deviate too much from recipe and it's so easy",
    "Tip: You can bake ham earlier in day, let it rest (loosely covered) for 30 minutes",
    "At this point I slice &amp; pile on oven safe platter, spoon on some drippings, cover tightly and re-heat about 15 minutes before serving",
    "Makes my life in the kitchen easier with the sides, etc",
    "needing the oven space",
    "just a mention :) Very yummy",
    "I made this for a surprise 50th birthday party and got many compliments",
    "I used light brown sugar (didn't have dark on hand) and wrapped the ham in foil while baking so it didn't dry out",
    "Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated",
    "This is a great and easy recipe",
    "Excellent recipe Elisa",
    "Like others suggested I doubled the glaze but kept the cloves at a minimum",
    "I had no trouble with the glaze burning on the bottom of the pan but maybe that was because the instructions on my spiral ham suggested it be cooked at 250 degrees",
    "I ended up adding cornstarch/water to the rest which made a delicious sauce",
    "Thank you so much and no more packets for me",
    "I didn't care too much for this",
    "The orange flavor was too overpowering and I didn't even use the full amount",
    "If I were to make it again I'd probably just leave out the zest and only use the orange juice",
    "I might also cut back on the dijon mustard - maybe 1 tbsp instead of 2",
    "Excellent",
    "Because I had only light brown sugar I added a couple tablespoons of dark brown corn syrup to give it that hint of molasses flavor--I could have used molasses just happened to have the dcs at hand",
    "I strained the pan juices for table use without the addition of any thickening agent since they were already slightly thickened from being in a large open roaster",
    "AWESOME",
    "I made this for a crowd (about 20 people) and they loved it",
    "I got so many complements",
    "Thanks for the great recipe",
    "Planing on making this for christmas dinner",
    "Good Heavens",
    "This was soooooo delicious",
    "I was looking for a recipe that had a pineapple sauce to pour over the ham but I was a little disappointed after I started cooking it and realized that it was more of a carmelized baste",
    "I had my husband slice it and of course he had to sample it first",
    "Before he even got finished slicing it he said that he must stop and take some over to the neighbor",
    "I then took a bite and loved it",
    "It was very juicy and tender",
    "We will definitely be making this again but I think I will still try to find a pineapple sauce to pour over it",
    "Thanks so much",
    "This ham was a hit at my house",
    "Everyone raved about how MMMM Good it was",
    "The only change I made was to score the ham before baking",
    "This allows the glaze to seep deeper into the ham",
    "I am making this ham again tomorrow for Easter",
    "Highly recommend",
    "Made this for Christmas",
    "It got devoured",
    "Very good flavor (I'm told) but I wouldn't recommend following this word for word with a spiral ham",
    "Give it about 30 minutes less cook time and drop the temp to 300 while glazing",
    "My guests ate every drop of the glaze (even on their mashed potatoes)",
    "this is so good",
    "I left out the mustard and it was perfect on my spiral cut ham",
    "I will be sure to use this again",
    "And its good to just dip your ham into when your eating it",
    "I made this ham for my family on Thanksgiving and it really will make people who don't like ham like it",
    "The glaze actually stays on the ham  I used this recipe for our Christmas ham",
    "It was delicious",
    "My family loved this",
    "The glaze is what made it",
    "I followed another reviewer's advice and put the ham in a bag with the glaze",
    "After 2 hours I opened the top of the bag and basted the ham with the glaze every ten minutes for another 1/2 hour",
    "It turned out tender and juicy",
    "The next morning I had hungry teenaged boys that had slept over and put the ham and glaze in a pan and carmelized the sauce",
    "They ate it all",
    "Great recipe",
    "I fixed this as part of a buffet for a Superbowl party, and it looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful",

    "I guess I just don't like cloves",
    "This was ok",
    "The glaze burned on the bottom of my roasting pan and gave the meat a bit of a burnt flavor",

    "They thought it had too much of an orange taste even though I did not put the full amount",
    "I did double the recipe as others have suggested but there was a strong citrus taste not for us",
    "The ham was very moist and juicy but I could taste the glaze only on the skin of the ham; the meat itself was still a little fresh",
    "Not the flavor I was expecting but nice nevertheless",
    "Followed the suggested cooking times and covering instructions",
